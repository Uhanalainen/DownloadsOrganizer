Simple script to move and organize files from Downloads folder

My downloads folder tends to get cluttered really badly and I have to do periodic cleanups of it,
but then usually I still leave stuff there which I want to keep, but in reality, I probably should
move it somewhere else that makes more sense.

Here's what I gather so far (likely to change):

Users\$user\Compressed
	- .7z, .zip

Users\$user\Documents
	- .pdf, .doc, .docx
	
Users\$user\Executables
	- .exe
	
Users\$user\Music
	- .flac, .mp3
	
Users\$user\Pictures
	- .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .eps
	
Users\$user\Videos
	- .mp4, .h264, .mkv
